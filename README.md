# <h1 align="center">Kafka Project Troubleshooting</h1>

  In this Kafka project, I've built a Kafka-based application inspired by a Udemy course. The project consists of a producer and a consumer, both containerized using Docker Compose. Before working with this application, there are some potential issues and requirements you should be aware of:
## âœ… Prerequisites
  Make sure to have docker running in you machine, if you dont have docker installed, follow this [documentation](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)
## :warning: Possible Issues:

- **Not Running the Producer's Docker Compose:** Make sure to run the Docker Compose for the producer component. Without it, the necessary Kafka infrastructure won't be available.

- **Blocked Ports:** Ensure that all required ports are open. Kafka relies on specific ports for communication, so blocked ports can cause issues.
  ### Producer ports
  -Port 2181: ZooKeeper
  -Port 9092: Kafka (Plaintext Listener)
  -Port 29092: Kafka (Outra Listener)
  -Port 9999: JMX para Kafka (Monitoramento)
  -Port 8083: Schema Registry
  -Port 8080: Conduktor Platform
  ### Consumer ports
  -Port 9200: OpenSearch (HTTP API)
  -Port 9600: OpenSearch Performance Analyzer
  -Port 5601: OpenSearch Dashboards (Kibana)

- **Running Consumer Before Producer:** The consumer component relies on the Kafka infrastructure provided by the producer. Therefore, you should run the producer's Docker Compose first, as the consumer won't function correctly without it.

## :computer: Access to Conducktor Platform:

  To access the Conducktor platform, you'll need to log in with the following credentials, which are defined in the producer's Docker Compose configuration:

- **Username:** admin@conduktor.io
- **Password:** admin
